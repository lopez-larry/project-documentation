# Document 7: Change Management Plan & Change Requests

---

## 1. Purpose

* Defines **how changes are proposed, evaluated, approved, and implemented**
* Prevents uncontrolled scope creep
* Ensures impacts to cost, schedule, risk, and architecture are understood
* Preserves integrity of approved requirements and contracts

---

## 2. What Constitutes a Change

A change is any modification to approved:

* Project scope or objectives
* Requirements (SRS)
* External guarantees or contracts (ACS)
* Architecture or design decisions (SDD)
* Schedule, cost, or delivery approach
* Security, compliance, or risk posture

If it alters an approved document, it is a **change**.

---

## 3. Change Principles

* No undocumented changes
* No implementation before approval
* All changes are impact-assessed
* Approved changes are traceable and auditable
* Emergency changes are allowed but must be documented retroactively

---

## 4. Change Roles & Responsibilities

* **Change Requestor**

  * Submits proposed change
* **Project Manager**

  * Coordinates review and decision process

  * Approves or rejects business impact
* **QA / Security (as applicable)**

  * Reviews quality and compliance impact

---

## 5. Change Review & Approval Workflow

1. Change Request submitted
2. Impact analysis performed
3. Risks identified or updated (Risk Register)
4. Decision made:

   * Approved
   * Approved with conditions
   * Rejected

6. Documents updated and versioned
