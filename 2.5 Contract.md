# 📄 2.5 — Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)

### Purpose

This document defines the **externally visible behavior** and **quality guarantees** the system must deliver to its consumers. It acts as a binding agreement between business stakeholders, architects, developers, and testers.

The Architecture Contract:

* Clarifies **what** the system promises (inputs, outputs, rules, performance)
* Ensures guarantees are **measurable** and **verifiable**
* Protects consumers from internal design changes
* Serves as the **Definition of Done** for system delivery
* Guides architecture design decisions in the SDD

> It separates **external promises** from **internal implementation**, creating a stable boundary.

## ✅ 1. Introduction

| Topic                  | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**              | Defines the system boundary: the operational interfaces, public schemas, security model, and service-level objectives |
| **Audience**           | Product Owner, Architect, Developers, Security Engineers, QA/Test                                                     |
| **References**         | SRS (Requirements), SDD (Design), OpenAPI Spec (if separate), Compliance Standards                                    |
| **Lifecycle Position** | Created after SRS approval and before SDD development                                                                 |

## ✅ 2. Data Contract (External Schema Definitions)

The data contract defines the **shape, meaning, and constraints** of information shared between the system and its consumers.

Schema definitions include:

* Field names and semantic meaning
* Data types and format constraints
* Required vs optional fields
* Business rules that affect data validity
* Public-only fields (no internal metadata exposure)

> Databases and persistence models are **not** authoritative sources.
> Only contract schemas may be relied upon by external consumers.

**Goal:** Ensure data integrity and stable integration across components.

---

## ✅ 3. API Contract (Public Operations & Behaviors)

This section formalizes the **external interface** of the system:

* Public API endpoints or message interfaces
* Allowed operations (HTTP verbs or function semantics)
* Request parameters and response formats
* Validation rules at the system boundary
* API versioning expectations
* Compatibility guarantees

> Describes WHAT each operation does, not HOW it is implemented.

This section may reference an attached **OpenAPI Specification** document or annex.

---

## ✅ 4. Error Contract

Standardizes how errors are communicated externally.

Includes:

* Error response shape (fields, structure)
* Error identifiers/codes
* When to expect specific classes of errors
* Expected consumer behavior (retry vs fail)

**Goal:** Provide predictable, testable, supportable failure handling.

---

## ✅ 5. Security Contract

Defines **system boundary security** — aligned with Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control.

Content includes:

* Authentication mechanism(s)
* Authorization policies (RBAC, ABAC, etc.)
* Data access rules and privacy protection
* Encryption requirements (data at rest / in transit)
* Audit and compliance expectations

> No security implementation or source code is included here — only policies and rules.

---

## ✅ 6. Quality Attribute Objectives (SLOs)

Defines **measurable architecture characteristics**, including:

* Performance (latency, throughput)
* Availability & uptime
* Reliability & recoverability
* Scalability expectations
* Data freshness or consistency requirements

Each objective includes:

* **Metric** — what is measured
* **Objective** — expected target
* **Measurement Window** — time period for success

> These objectives guide architectural trade-offs and technology choices.

---

## ✅ 7. Versioning & Compatibility Strategy

Establishes rules for:

* How versions are numbered and published
* Deprecation timelines
* Backward-compatibility guarantees
* Consumer migration support

> Protects consumers from breaking changes to system boundaries.

---

## ✅ 8. Acceptance Criteria

The contract is **fulfilled** only when all of these are complete:

| Requirement                                    | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| All API endpoints implemented per contract     | ☐      |
| Schemas validated against contract definitions | ☐      |
| Security enforcement meets contract rules      | ☐      |
| SLOs verified by objective tests               | ☐      |
| Error responses match Error Contract           | ☐      |
| Documentation available to all consumers       | ☐      |

> These criteria constitute the **Definition of Done** for the system boundary.

## 🔚 Final Note

This specification is a **binding agreement**:

* NOT optional
* Enforced throughout development
* The reference standard for testing and acceptance
* The foundation for all architecture design decisions

Once approved, any change **must** follow controlled version governance.
