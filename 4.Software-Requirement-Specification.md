# Document 4: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose**

* Defines **what the system must do**
* Serves as the authoritative source for functional and non-functional requirements

**Scope**

* Capabilities and behaviors the software will and will not provide
* Implementation details are explicitly out of scope

**Definitions & Acronyms**

* Domain-specific terms
* Shared vocabulary across stakeholders

**References**

* Project Charter
* Stakeholder Communication Plan
* Risk Management Plan & Risk Register
* Applicable standards, policies, regulations

---

## 2. Overall Description

**Product Perspective**

* Relationship to existing systems (standalone, integrated, replacement)
* External dependencies at a conceptual level only

**Product Functions**

* High-level summary of major system capabilities
* No detailed workflows or logic

**User Classes & Characteristics**

* Identified user roles (e.g., admin, operator, customer)
* Skill level, access expectations, usage patterns

**Operating Environment**

* Target platforms (OS, browsers, devices)
* Deployment context (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)

**Design & Implementation Constraints**

* Mandatory constraints only:

  * Regulatory
  * Compliance
  * Contractual
* Detailed design choices belong in ACS / SDD

**Assumptions & Dependencies**

* Planning assumptions
* External dependencies
* Reference Risk IDs where assumptions introduce risk

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

Defines **observable system behavior**.

Each requirement must be:

* Atomic
* Testable
* Unambiguous

### Requirement Format

* **ID:** FR-XX
* **Description:** “The system shall…”
* **Priority:** High / Medium / Low
* **Inputs**
* **Outputs**
* **Preconditions**
* **Postconditions**
* **Related Risks:** Risk IDs (if applicable)

### Examples

* **FR-01:** The system shall allow users to upload up to 10 images per listing.
* **FR-02:** The system shall allow users to filter results by defined attributes.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

Defines **quality attributes and constraints**.

Each NFR must be measurable where possible.

### Categories

* **Performance**

  * Response time
  * Throughput
  * Load limits

* **Security**

  * Authentication
  * Authorization
  * Encryption
  * Audit logging

* **Usability**

  * Accessibility standards
  * Supported devices

* **Reliability & Availability**

  * Uptime targets
  * Failure handling

* **Maintainability**

  * Modularity expectations
  * Documentation requirements

* **Portability**

  * Supported platforms and environments

Each NFR may reference:

* Risk IDs
* External standards
* Acceptance criteria defined later in ACS

---

## 5. Use Cases (Optional)

Provides narrative support for understanding behavior.

**Use Case Elements**

* Use Case ID
* Actors
* Preconditions
* Main Flow
* Alternate Flows
* Postconditions

Use cases **supplement** requirements; they do not replace them.

---

## 6. Data Requirements

Defines **logical data needs**, not physical implementation.

* Key data entities and relationships (conceptual)
* Data classification (public, internal, sensitive)
* Data retention requirements
* Privacy and regulatory considerations

Physical schemas belong in the SDD.

---

## 7. External Interface Requirements

Defines **what the system must expose or consume**, without locking implementation.

* **User Interfaces**

  * Required UI capabilities
  * Accessibility requirements
  * UI standards references

* **APIs**

  * Required operations
  * Expected inputs and outputs
  * Error conditions (high-level)

* **External Systems**

  * Conceptual integration points
  * Dependencies and expectations

Detailed API contracts belong in the ACS.

---

## 8. Requirements Traceability & Change Control

**Traceability**

* Each requirement must trace to:

  * Project objectives
  * Business needs
  * Test cases
* IDs are mandatory

**Change Control**

* Changes to requirements require:

  * Approved Change Request
  * Impact analysis
  * Risk assessment
* No inline edits without change approval

---

## 9. Appendices

* Glossary
* Standards references
* Supporting materials

---

## Guardrails (Critical)

* This document defines **what**, not **how**
* Architecture, APIs, schemas, and guarantees live in the **Architecture Contract Specification**
* Design decisions live in the **Software Design Document**
* Risks are referenced by ID only
