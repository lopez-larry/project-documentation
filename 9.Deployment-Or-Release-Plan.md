# Document 9: **Deployment / Release Plan**

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose**

* Defines how the system is deployed and released into production
* Ensures deployment is controlled, repeatable, and recoverable

**Scope**

* Systems, environments, and features included in this release
* Explicit exclusions (what is not part of this deployment)

**References**

* Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
* Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)
* Software Design Document (SDD / SAD)
* Test Plan
* Risk Management Plan & Risk Register
* Change Management Plan

---

## 2. Deployment Overview

**Deployment Strategy**

* Deployment approach used:

  * Big-bang
  * Phased rollout
  * Pilot
  * Blue-green
  * Canary
* Rationale for chosen strategy
* Reference Risk IDs influencing deployment approach

**Environments**

* Development
* Test
* UAT
* Production
* Environment parity assumptions and known gaps

**Release Impact**

* Target audience affected:

  * End users
  * Administrators
  * Operations / Support
* Expected user-visible changes

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

* **Release Manager**

  * Owns deployment execution and go/no-go decision coordination
* **DevOps / Platform Engineer**

  * Executes deployment procedures
  * Verifies infrastructure readiness
* **QA / Test Team**

  * Performs post-deployment validation
* **Project Manager**

  * Coordinates approvals and stakeholder communication
* **Support / Operations**

  * Monitors system post-release

---

## 4. Pre-Deployment Readiness

**Approval Gates**

* Test Plan exit criteria met
* ACS acceptance criteria satisfied
* No unresolved high-severity defects
* Approved Change Requests incorporated

**Pre-Deployment Checklist**

* Database backups completed
* Infrastructure verified
* Monitoring and alerting enabled
* Rollback artifacts available
* Deployment approval recorded

---

## 5. Deployment Procedure

**Execution Steps**

* Retrieve approved release artifacts
* Build and package application
* Deploy backend services
* Deploy frontend components
* Apply configuration and secrets
* Execute database migrations (if applicable)

**Controls**

* Steps executed according to approved scripts/runbooks
* Deviations require explicit approval

---

## 6. Post-Deployment Verification

* Smoke tests executed
* Key workflows validated
* Monitoring confirms system health
* ACS contract checks (APIs, schemas, security rules)
* Performance indicators within acceptable range

Release is not complete until verification passes.

---

## 7. Rollback Plan

**Rollback Triggers**

* Deployment failure
* Critical functional defect
* Security or data integrity issue
* SLA/SLO breach beyond tolerance

**Rollback Actions**

* Restore database backups
* Revert application to last stable version
* Validate system stability
* Communicate rollback status

Rollback procedures must be tested prior to production release.

---

## 8. Communication Plan

**Before Deployment**

* Notify stakeholders of planned deployment
* Communicate expected impact or downtime

**During Deployment**

* Status updates at defined checkpoints
* Escalation if issues arise

**After Deployment**

* Confirmation of success
* Summary of issues (if any)
* Next steps or follow-up actions

Detailed communication expectations reference the **Stakeholder Communication Plan**.

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

Risks are referenced, not duplicated.

Examples:

* Downtime risk → Off-peak deployment (Risk ID)
* Migration failure → Staged migrations and backups (Risk ID)
* Performance regression → Monitoring and rollback thresholds (Risk ID)

All risks must be tracked in the **Risk Register**.

---

## 10. Release Schedule & Cutover

* Planned start time
* Expected duration
* Contingency window
* Cutover approach:

  * Traffic switch timing
  * Feature toggles (if used)
* Post-release monitoring window

---

## Deployment Guardrails (Explicit)

* Deployment does not authorize scope change
* Only approved changes are deployed
* ACS defines release acceptance criteria
* Rollback capability is mandatory
* Risk posture must be acceptable before go-live
