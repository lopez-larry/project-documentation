# Document 3: Risk Management Plan & Risk Register

---

## 1. Purpose

* Establishes a structured approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and tracking risks
* Provides a **centralized risk register** for the entire project lifecycle
* Enables informed decision-making and controlled escalation

---

## 2. Risk Management Objectives

* Identify risks early and continuously
* Assess risk exposure consistently
* Assign clear ownership and mitigation actions
* Monitor risk status throughout the project
* Escalate risks before they become issues

---

## 3. Risk Scope

This plan applies to all project phases, including:

* Initiation
* Requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Post-implementation

All risks identified in other documents must be **recorded here**.

---

## 4. Risk Categories

Risks are classified to ensure balanced coverage:

* **Business** – funding, priorities, sponsorship
* **Schedule** – timelines, dependencies, resource availability
* **Technical** – architecture, performance, integration
* **Security** – access control, data protection, compliance
* **Operational** – deployment, support, maintenance
* **Compliance / Legal** – regulatory or contractual obligations
* **External** – vendors, third-party services, external approvals

---

## 5. Risk Assessment Method

### 5.1 Probability Scale

* Low – unlikely to occur
* Medium – possible
* High – likely to occur

### 5.2 Impact Scale

* Low – minimal impact, manageable locally
* Medium – noticeable impact requiring management attention
* High – major impact to scope, schedule, cost, or quality

### 5.3 Risk Rating

* Risk Exposure = Probability × Impact
* Used to determine mitigation priority and escalation

---

## 6. Risk Responses

Each risk must have a defined response strategy:

* **Avoid** – eliminate the risk entirely
* **Mitigate** – reduce probability or impact
* **Transfer** – shift risk to a third party
* **Accept** – acknowledge and monitor

---

## 7. Risk Ownership & Governance

* Every risk has a single accountable owner

* Owners are responsible for:

  * Monitoring risk status
  * Executing mitigation actions
  * Reporting changes in exposure

* Escalation thresholds:

  * High-exposure risks escalated to Sponsor
  * Medium risks reviewed regularly
  * Low risks monitored

---

## 8. Risk Review Cadence

* Risk register reviewed:

  * At major milestones
  * During change reviews
  * Prior to deployment
* Ad-hoc reviews triggered by:

  * New dependencies
  * Approved changes
  * Emerging issues

---

## 9. Risk Register

The risk register is the **authoritative record** of all project risks.

### Risk Register Fields

* **Risk ID**
* **Risk Description**
* **Category**
* **Probability**
* **Impact**
* **Risk Exposure**
* **Mitigation / Response**
* **Owner**
* **Status**
* **Last Reviewed Date**

---

## 10. Integration with Other Documents

* **Project Charter** – seeds initial risks
* **SRS / ACS / Design** – add technical and quality risks
* **Change Requests** – introduce new risks
* **Test Plan** – identifies validation and quality risks
* **Deployment Plan** – captures operational risks
* **Project Closure** – documents realized risks and lessons learned

Other documents **reference Risk IDs only**.

### Operating Rules (Non-Negotiable)

* Risks are documented **once**, here
* No duplicated risk descriptions elsewhere
* If a risk is discussed, it **must have a Risk ID**
* Issues are risks that have materialized
