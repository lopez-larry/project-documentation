### Usage Notes

* This document defines **how information flows**, not project work
* It complements:

  * Project Charter (stakeholders)
  * Risk Management (escalations)
  * Change Management (decision visibility)
* It should remain **stable** unless stakeholder structure changes

---

### Why This Is a Separate Document

* Communication is a **control mechanism**, not a side activity
* This avoids:

  * Informal decision-making
  * Missed approvals
  * Stakeholder surprises
