# Master Documentation Instruction Guide

*(Reader + Writer Guide)*

## Purpose

This guide standardizes how we create and read project documentation.

* **Writers**: Learn what to include and how to format each document.
* **Readers**: Understand what each document contains and which sections matter to you.
* **Culture Goal**: Documentation should be **efficient, bullet-form, bottom-line up front**, with this guide providing deeper explanation where needed.

---

## General Guidance

* Not every reader needs every detail — use this guide to **jump to what matters for your role**.

* All documents work together as a governed system:

  * Charter → *why* the project exists
  * Stakeholder Communication Plan → *who needs to know what, when, and how*
  * Risk Management → *what could go wrong and how we control it*
  * SRS → *what* will be built
  * ACS → *what the system guarantees externally*
  * Design → *how* it will be built
  * Change Management → *how approved change is controlled*
  * Test Plan → *how* it will be validated
  * Deployment → *how* it will be delivered
  * Closure → *how it ended and what was learned*

* All documents should be **bullet form** unless a paragraph is absolutely necessary.

* Each document should be **5–10 pages max** (most under 5).

* Each document must link back to this guide.

* Readers should always check this guide first for context.

## Document Types

---

### 1. Project Charter

**Purpose:**
Authorizes the project and establishes high-level intent.

**Defines:**

* Why the project exists
* What success looks like
* Who has authority
* Initial high-level risks

**How to Write:**

* Short bullets, no narratives
* Required sections:

  * Purpose
  * Objectives
  * Scope (In / Out)
  * High-Level Risks
  * Key Stakeholders
  * Approvals

**How to Read:**

* Executives/Sponsors → Purpose, Objectives, Risks
* PM/BA → Entire document
* Developers/QA → Objectives and Scope

---

### 2. Stakeholder Communication Plan

**Purpose:**
Defines **how project information flows** to stakeholders.

**Answers:**

* Who needs information?
* What do they need to know?
* When and how will they be informed?
* Who is responsible for communication?

**How to Write:**

* Stakeholder communication matrix:

  * Stakeholder / Role
  * Information Needed
  * Frequency
  * Communication Method
  * Owner
* Include escalation paths
* Keep it operational and explicit

**How to Read:**

* PM → Primary operating reference
* Executives → Cadence and escalation
* Team Leads → Reporting expectations

---

### 3. Risk Management Plan & Risk Register

**Purpose:**
Centralizes identification, assessment, ownership, and tracking of risks across the entire project lifecycle.

**Role in the System:**

* Acts as the **single source of truth for risk**
* All other documents **reference Risk IDs**, not duplicate risk descriptions

**Defines:**

* Risk categories (Business, Technical, Security, Schedule, Operational, Compliance)
* Risk scoring method (Probability × Impact)
* Risk ownership and mitigation strategies
* Escalation thresholds
* Review cadence

**Risk Register Fields:**

* Risk ID
* Description
* Category
* Probability
* Impact
* Mitigation / Response
* Owner
* Status

**How to Read:**

* PM → Primary governance tool
* Architects → Technical and systemic risks
* Stakeholders → Exposure and mitigation posture

---

### 4. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Purpose:**
Defines **what** will be built — functional and non-functional requirements.

**How to Write:**

* Use requirement IDs (FR-01, NFR-02)
* Functional requirements must describe observable behavior
* Non-functional requirements must be measurable
* Reference applicable Risk IDs where relevant

**How to Read:**

* BA/PM → Scope and requirements
* Developers/QA → Entire document
* Executives → Objectives and summary

---

### 5. Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)

**Purpose:**
Defines the **external guarantees of the system**.

**Role in the System:**

* Bridges **SRS (what)** and **Design (how)**
* Locks external promises while allowing internal flexibility

**Defines:**

* External data schemas (not database schema)
* API operations (inputs/outputs)
* Error handling rules
* Security and access policies
* Quality objectives (SLOs)
* Versioning and compatibility rules
* Acceptance criteria (Definition of Done)

**How to Write:**

* Bullet each contract element
* Consumer-focused
* Implementation-agnostic
* Reference Requirement IDs and Risk IDs

**How to Read:**

* Architects → Entire document
* Developers → APIs, errors, security, acceptance criteria
* QA → Error contracts, SLOs
* PM/Product → High-level guarantees

---

### 6. Software Design Document (SDD / SAD)

**Purpose:**
Defines **how** the system will be built.

**How to Write:**

* Architecture diagrams
* Component responsibilities
* Data flows
* APIs and database schema
* Design decisions reference Risk IDs and mitigations

**How to Read:**

* Developers → Detailed design
* DevOps → Deployment and security sections
* PM → System overview

---

### 7. Change Management Plan & Change Requests

**Purpose:**
Controls approved changes to scope, requirements, schedule, or design.

**Change Management Plan Defines:**

* What qualifies as a change
* Approval authority
* Impact analysis criteria
* Emergency vs standard change handling
* Change log ownership

**Change Request Captures:**

* Description and rationale
* Impact analysis (scope, cost, schedule, risk)
* Approval decision
* Implementation references

**How to Read:**

* PM → Governance control
* Architects → Design impact
* Stakeholders → Decision traceability

---

### 8. Test Plan

**Purpose:**
Defines how requirements and contracts will be validated.

**How to Write:**

* Test levels:

  * Unit
  * Integration
  * System
  * UAT
* Entry and exit criteria
* Test artifacts
* Quality risks reference Risk IDs

**How to Read:**

* QA → Entire document
* Developers → Unit and integration
* PM → Readiness and risk exposure

---

### 9. Deployment / Release Plan

**Purpose:**
Defines how the system goes live and how failure is handled.

**How to Write:**

* Pre-deployment steps
* Deployment steps
* Post-deployment validation
* Rollback procedures
* Release communications
* Role assignments
* Operational risks reference Risk IDs

**How to Read:**

* DevOps/Release → Entire document
* Developers/QA → Pre/Post steps
* PM → Timing, risk, communication

---

### 10. Project Closure / Post-Implementation Report

**Purpose:**
Formally closes the project and captures learning.

**How to Write:**

* Planned vs actual outcomes
* Completed vs deferred deliverables
* Realized risks and outcomes
* Lessons learned
* Stakeholder feedback
* Transition notes

**How to Read:**

* Sponsors → Outcomes and lessons
* PM → Entire document
* Team → Feedback and transition guidance

---

## Structural Rules (Explicit)

* Risk is **documented once**, centrally
* All other documents **reference Risk IDs**
* No duplicated risk descriptions
* Governance clarity beats document volume
