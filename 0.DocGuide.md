# 📘 Master Documentation Instruction Guide

*(Reader + Writer Guide)*

## Purpose

This guide standardizes how we create and read project documentation.

* **Writers**: Learn what to include and how to format each doc.
* **Readers**: Understand what each doc contains and which sections matter to you.
* **Culture Goal**: Documents should be **efficient, bullet-form, bottom-line up front**, with this guide providing the deeper explanation where needed.

## General Guidance

* Not every reader needs every detail — use this guide to **jump to what matters for your role.**.

* All documents work together:
  * Charter → *why* the project exists.
  * SRS → *what* will be built.
  * ACS → *what* the system guarantees externally*.
  * Design → *how* it will be built.
  * Test Plan → *how* it will be validated.
  * Deployment → *how* it will be delivered.
  * Closure → *how* it ended and lessons learned.

* All docs should be **bullet form** unless a paragraph is absolutely necessary.
* Each doc must be no longer than **5–10 pages max** (most under 5).
* Each doc must link back to this guide.
* Readers should always check this guide first for context.

## Document Types

### 1. Project Charter

* **Purpose:** Authorizes the project, defines objectives, scope, and key risks.
* **How to Write:**

  * Use short bullets, not long paragraphs.
  * Required: Purpose, Objectives, Scope (In/Out), High-Level Risks, Approvals.
* **How to Read:**

  * Executives/Sponsors → Focus on Purpose, Objectives, Risks.
  * PM/BA → Read full doc.
  * Developers/QA → Skim Objectives and Scope.

---

### 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

* **Purpose:** Defines **what** will be built — functional + non-functional requirements.
* **How to Write:**

  * Use IDs (FR-01, NFR-02).
  * Functional: testable behaviors.
  * Non-Functional: performance, security, compliance.
  * Keep descriptions short and testable.
* **How to Read:**

  * BA/PM → Review Scope, Requirements, Use Cases.
  * Developers/QA → Read all requirements.
  * Executives → Skim Objectives and Summary.

---

### **2.5. Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)**

* **Purpose:** Defines the **system boundary contract** — what the system guarantees externally (schemas, APIs, error rules, security, service-level objectives).

  * Bridges SRS (*what must be built*) and SDD (*how it will be built*).
  * Establishes measurable, stable guarantees the architecture must deliver.

* **How to Write:**

  * Bullet each contract element:

    * External Data Schemas (NOT database schema)
    * API Operations (inputs/outputs)
    * Error Handling Rules
    * Security & Access Policies
    * Quality Objectives (performance, availability, reliability)
    * Versioning & Compatibility Rules
    * Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
  * Keep content consumer-focused and implementation-agnostic.
  * Include appendices for contract creation meetings, workflow, and governance.

* **How to Read:**

  * Architects → Read entire document.
  * Developers → Read API, Error, Security, and Acceptance Criteria.
  * QA → Read Error Contract, SLOs, and Acceptance Criteria.
  * PM/Product Owner → Review high-level guarantees and constraints.

---

### 3. Software Design Document (SDD / SAD)

* **Purpose:** Defines **how** the system will be built — architecture, modules, data flows.
* **How to Write:**

  * Include diagrams (architecture, data flow, ERD).
  * Document APIs, DB schema, components.
  * Bullet each module’s responsibilities.
* **How to Read:**

  * Developers → Study Detailed Design and APIs.
  * DevOps → Read Deployment + Security.
  * PM → Skim System Overview.

---

### 4. Test Plan

* **Purpose:** Defines how requirements will be validated.
* **How to Write:**

  * Use bullets for test levels (Unit, Integration, System, UAT).
  * Entry/Exit criteria must be clear.
  * List Test Deliverables: Cases, Logs, Reports.
* **How to Read:**

  * QA → Read everything.
  * Developers → Focus on Unit/Integration.
  * PM → Look at Objectives, Risks, Schedule.

---

### 5. Deployment / Release Plan

* **Purpose:** Defines how the system will go live and how rollback works.
* **How to Write:**

  * Bullet the steps: Pre-Deployment, Deployment, Post-Deployment.
  * Include Rollback Plan and Communication Plan.
  * Assign roles (DevOps, PM, QA).
* **How to Read:**

  * DevOps/Release → Read all.
  * Developers/QA → Focus on Pre/Post Deployment.
  * PM → Focus on Risks, Communication, Schedule.

---

### 6. Project Closure / Post-Implementation Report

* **Purpose:** Wraps up the project, compares planned vs actual, captures lessons learned.
* **How to Write:**

  * Bullet Objectives vs Outcomes.
  * Note Deliverables completed/not completed.
  * Capture top 3 Lessons Learned.
  * Record Stakeholder Feedback.
* **How to Read:**

  * Sponsors/Execs → Focus on Outcomes + Lessons.
  * PM → Read entire doc.
  * Team → Skim Feedback + Transition.
