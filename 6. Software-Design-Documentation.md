# Document 6: Software Design Document (SDD / SAD)

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose**

* Defines **how the system will be built** to satisfy approved requirements and contracts
* Translates external guarantees (ACS) into internal architecture and design decisions

**Scope**

* Covers internal system structure, components, data stores, and interactions
* Excludes externally binding contracts, schemas, and guarantees (owned by ACS)

**References**

* Project Charter
* Stakeholder Communication Plan
* Risk Management Plan & Risk Register
* Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
* Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)
* Applicable standards and policies

---

## 2. System Overview

**High-Level Description**

* Brief summary of the system’s purpose and context
* How this system fits within the broader ecosystem

**Architecture Style**

* Selected architecture style(s) (e.g., layered, client-server, microservices)
* Rationale for selection
* Reference Risk IDs influencing architectural choices

**Technology Stack**

* Programming languages
* Frameworks and libraries
* Databases and storage
* Hosting / infrastructure platforms
* Third-party services and dependencies

---

## 3. System Architecture

**Architecture Diagrams**

* Logical architecture (components and relationships)
* Physical architecture (deployment topology)
* Diagrams should match the approved ACS boundaries

**Component Descriptions**
For each major component:

* Name
* Responsibilities
* Internal interfaces
* Dependencies
* Referenced Risk IDs (if applicable)

**Data Flow**

* Internal data movement between components
* High-level sequences (user → service → storage)
* External flows must align with ACS contracts

**Deployment Architecture**

* Environments (Dev, Test, Prod)
* Infrastructure model (VMs, containers, managed services)
* Network segmentation and boundaries

---

## 4. Detailed Design

**Modules & Components**
For each module:

* Responsibilities
* Internal interfaces
* Dependencies
* Design patterns used (if relevant)
* Traceability to Requirement IDs and Contract elements

**Database Design**

* Physical data model
* Table definitions
* Relationships and constraints
* Indexing and performance considerations
* Data classification alignment with ACS and Risk IDs

**Internal API Design**

* Internal service interfaces
* Method signatures or endpoints
* Data formats
* These are **implementation details**, not consumer contracts

---

## 5. User Interface Design

**UI Structure**

* Screen flows and navigation logic
* Component hierarchy

**Wireframes / Mockups**

* Visual references
* Interaction patterns

**UI Standards**

* Accessibility requirements
* Usability guidelines
* Consistency rules

---

## 6. Security Design (Implementation View)

Defines **how** ACS security rules are enforced internally.

Includes:

* Authentication flow implementation
* Authorization enforcement points
* Secure data handling mechanisms
* Secret management
* Audit logging implementation

**Rule:**

* Policies are defined in ACS
* Enforcement mechanisms are defined here

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability Design

* Scaling model (horizontal, vertical)
* Load balancing approach
* Caching strategies
* Capacity planning assumptions
* Performance-related Risk IDs and mitigations

---

## 8. Error Handling & Recovery Design

* Internal error handling patterns
* Retry strategies
* Circuit breakers or failover logic
* Backup and restore mechanisms
* Recovery alignment with ACS Error Contract

---

## 9. Design Decisions & Trade-Offs

* Significant architectural or design decisions
* Alternatives considered
* Rationale for final choice
* Risks introduced or mitigated
* Reference to Risk IDs and Change Requests (if applicable)

---

## 10. Traceability & Change Control

**Traceability**

* Design elements trace to:

  * Requirement IDs (SRS)
  * Contract elements (ACS)
  * Risk IDs

**Change Control**

* Design changes require:

  * Approved Change Request
  * Impact analysis
  * Risk review
* No undocumented deviations from ACS or SRS

---

## 11. Appendix

* Glossary
* Supporting diagrams
* Reference material

---

## Design Guardrails (Explicit)

* This document defines **how**, not **what**
* External contracts are not redefined here
* Consumer-facing behavior must conform to the ACS
* Risks are referenced by ID only
* Design exists to **fulfill contracts and requirements**, not reinterpret them
