# Document 5 — Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **externally visible behavior** and **quality guarantees** the system must deliver to its consumers. It acts as a binding agreement between business stakeholders, architects, developers, and testers.

The Architecture Contract:

* Clarifies **what** the system promises (inputs, outputs, rules, performance)
* Ensures guarantees are **measurable** and **verifiable**
* Protects consumers from internal design changes
* Serves as the **Definition of Done** for system delivery
* Guides architecture decisions captured in the SDD

> This document separates **external promises** from **internal implementation**, creating a stable and governable system boundary.

## 1. Introduction

| Topic                  | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**              | Defines the system boundary: external interfaces, public schemas, security rules, and service-level objectives      |
| **Audience**           | Product Owner, Architect, Developers, Security Engineers, QA/Test                                                   |
| **References**         | SRS, Risk Management Plan & Risk Register, Change Management Plan, OpenAPI Spec (if separate), Compliance Standards |
| **Lifecycle Position** | Created after SRS approval and before Software Design Document (SDD) development                                    |

## 2. Data Contract (External Schema Definitions)

Defines the **shape, meaning, and constraints** of information exchanged with external consumers.

Schema definitions include:

* Field names and semantic meaning
* Data types and format constraints
* Required vs optional fields
* Business rules affecting data validity
* Public-only fields (no internal metadata exposure)

**Rules:**

* Databases and persistence models are **not authoritative**
* Only published contract schemas may be relied upon by consumers
* Schema changes require versioned contract updates

**Related Risks:**

* Reference applicable Risk IDs (e.g., data integrity, compatibility, privacy)

---

## 3. API Contract (Public Operations & Behaviors)

Defines the **externally observable system behavior**.

Includes:

* Public API endpoints or message interfaces
* Allowed operations (HTTP verbs or semantic actions)
* Request parameters and response formats
* Boundary-level validation rules
* API versioning expectations
* Backward-compatibility guarantees

> Describes **what** each operation does, not **how** it is implemented.

This section may reference an attached **OpenAPI Specification** as a controlled artifact.

**Related Risks:**

* Reference Risk IDs for availability, abuse, misuse, or dependency risks

---

## 4. Error Contract

Standardizes how failures are communicated externally.

Includes:

* Error response structure
* Error identifiers or codes
* Conditions under which errors are returned
* Consumer expectations (retry, fail, escalate)

**Goal:** Predictable, testable, and supportable failure handling.

**Related Risks:**

* Reference Risk IDs related to reliability, observability, and recovery

---

## 5. Security Contract

Defines **boundary-level security guarantees**.

Includes:

* Authentication mechanisms
* Authorization model (RBAC, ABAC, etc.)
* Data access and privacy rules
* Encryption requirements (in transit and at rest)
* Audit and compliance expectations

**Rules:**

* No implementation details
* Policies and guarantees only
* Enforcement is validated through acceptance testing

**Related Risks:**

* Reference security and compliance Risk IDs

---

## 6. Quality Attribute Objectives (SLOs)

Defines **measurable architecture characteristics**.

Examples include:

* Performance (latency, throughput)
* Availability and uptime
* Reliability and recoverability
* Scalability expectations
* Data consistency or freshness

Each objective includes:

* **Metric**
* **Target Objective**
* **Measurement Window**

> These objectives guide architecture trade-offs and technology selection.

**Related Risks:**

* Reference Risk IDs associated with capacity, performance, or resilience

---

## 7. Versioning & Compatibility Strategy

Establishes governance for contract evolution:

* Versioning scheme
* Deprecation rules
* Backward-compatibility guarantees
* Consumer migration expectations

**Rule:**
Breaking changes require a new contract version and approved Change Request.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

The contract is considered **fulfilled** only when all criteria are met:

| Requirement                                    | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| APIs implemented per contract                  | ☐      |
| Schemas validated against contract definitions | ☐      |
| Security rules enforced and verified           | ☐      |
| SLOs validated via objective testing           | ☐      |
| Error handling conforms to Error Contract      | ☐      |
| Consumer-facing documentation published        | ☐      |

---

## 9. Change Control & Governance

* The ACS is a **version-controlled artifact**
* Changes require:

  * Approved Change Request
  * Impact analysis
  * Risk assessment
* All revisions must preserve consumer guarantees or explicitly version them

## Final Note

This specification is a **binding agreement**:

* Not optional
* Enforced throughout development
* Authoritative for testing and acceptance
* Governs all external system behavior

Once approved, any change **must follow formal change and version control**.
