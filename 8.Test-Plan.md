# Document 8: **Test Plan**

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose**

* Defines how the system will be **verified and validated**
* Confirms that requirements and architecture contracts are met before release

**Scope**

* Features, functions, and quality attributes included in testing
* Explicit exclusions (out of scope for this test cycle)

**References**

* Project Charter
* Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
* Architecture Contract Specification (ACS)
* Software Design Document (SDD / SAD)
* Risk Management Plan & Risk Register
* Change Management Plan

---

## 2. Test Objectives

* Verify functional requirements are implemented correctly
* Validate non-functional requirements and quality objectives
* Verify compliance with external contracts (ACS)
* Identify, track, and resolve defects
* Reduce project risk prior to release

---

## 3. Test Items

* System components, modules, or subsystems under test
* Example:

  * Authentication
  * Authorization
  * Core business workflows
  * External integrations
  * Reporting and data persistence

Each test item must trace to:

* Requirement IDs (SRS)
* Contract elements (ACS)
* Risk IDs (where applicable)

---

## 4. Test Levels

* **Unit Testing**

  * Performed by developers
  * Verifies internal logic and components

* **Integration Testing**

  * Verifies interaction between components and services
  * Includes internal APIs and data flows

* **System Testing**

  * End-to-end validation of system behavior
  * Confirms compliance with SRS and ACS

* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

  * Business stakeholders validate requirements
  * Confirms system meets business intent

---

## 5. Test Approach

**Methodology**

* Manual
* Automated
* Hybrid

**Tools**

* Unit / Integration: Jest, Mocha, pytest, etc.
* API: Postman, REST clients
* UI: Cypress, Selenium
* Performance: JMeter, k6

**Entry Criteria**

* Approved requirements baseline
* Test environment available
* Test data prepared

**Exit Criteria**

* All critical and high-severity defects resolved or accepted
* Required pass rates achieved
* Contract acceptance criteria met
* No unresolved high-exposure risks

---

## 6. Test Environment

* Hardware and infrastructure
* Operating systems and browsers
* Devices and platforms
* Test accounts and data sets

Environment configuration must align with:

* Deployment assumptions
* Risk mitigation strategies

---

## 7. Test Deliverables

* Test cases and scripts
* Automated test results
* Defect log
* Test summary report
* Contract validation evidence (ACS)

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

* **QA Lead**

  * Owns the test plan
  * Coordinates execution and reporting

* **Developers**

  * Perform unit testing
  * Resolve defects

* **Testers / QA Engineers**

  * Execute test cases
  * Log and verify defects

* **Business Users / Clients**

  * Perform UAT
  * Approve readiness

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

Risks are **referenced**, not duplicated.

Examples:

* Requirements ambiguity → Traceability reviews (Risk ID)
* Environment instability → Backup environments (Risk ID)
* Schedule compression → Risk-based testing prioritization (Risk ID)

All risks must reference entries in the **Risk Register**.

---

## 10. Defect Management & Change Control

* Defects are logged, categorized, and prioritized
* Defects requiring requirement or contract changes:

  * Trigger a Change Request
  * Follow the Change Management Plan
* No scope changes occur through testing without approval

---

## 11. Test Schedule

* Testing activities mapped to project milestones or sprint cycles
* Includes:

  * Test preparation
  * Execution
  * Defect resolution
  * Regression testing
  * UAT

---

## Test Guardrails (Explicit)

* Testing validates **what was approved**, not what is convenient
* ACS defines contract acceptance criteria
* SDD defines internal validation expectations
* Risks are tracked centrally, not restated
* Testing does not authorize scope change
