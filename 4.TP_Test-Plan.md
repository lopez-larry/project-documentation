# 📄 Document 4: **Test Plan**

## 1. Introduction

* **Purpose:** Why we’re testing (to validate requirements).
* **Scope:** Features/functions included in testing, what’s excluded.
* **References:** Link to SRS, SDD, project charter.

---

## 2. Test Objectives

* Verify that the system meets functional requirements.
* Verify that the system meets non-functional requirements (performance, security).
* Identify and log defects.

---

## 3. Test Items

* Modules, features, or subsystems being tested.
* Example: *Dog Listings, Authentication, Messaging, Payments.*

---

## 4. Test Levels

* **Unit Testing** (by developers).
* **Integration Testing** (modules working together).
* **System Testing** (end-to-end functionality).
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Stakeholders validate requirements.

---

## 5. Test Approach

* **Methodology:** Manual, automated, or hybrid.
* **Tools:** Jest, Mocha, Cypress, Postman, Selenium, JMeter.
* **Entry/Exit Criteria:**

  * Entry: Code complete, test environment ready.
  * Exit: All critical defects resolved, pass rate ≥ 95%.

---

## 6. Test Environment

* Hardware, OS, browsers, devices.
* Example: *Chrome, Safari, iOS, Android, AWS EC2 test servers.*

---

## 7. Test Deliverables

* **Test Cases / Scripts.**
* **Defect Log.**
* **Test Summary Reports.**

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities

* **QA Lead:** Owns plan, coordinates testing.
* **Developers:** Unit testing, fix bugs.
* **Testers:** Execute cases, log defects.
* **Users/Clients:** Perform UAT.

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

* Incomplete requirements → Regular walkthroughs.
* Environment instability → Backup test environments.
* Resource constraints → Prioritize high-risk features.

---

## 10. Schedule

* Testing phases mapped to project timeline (e.g., sprint cycles, release dates).
