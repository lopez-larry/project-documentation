# 📄 Document 5: **Deployment / Release Plan**

## 1. Introduction

* **Purpose:** Define how the system will be deployed into production.
* **Scope:** Which systems, environments, and features are included.
* **References:** Link to SRS, Design Docs, Test Plan.

---

## 2. Deployment Overview

* **Deployment Strategy:** Big-bang, phased rollout, pilot, blue-green, canary.
* **Environments:** Dev → Test → UAT → Production.
* **Target Audience:** Who is affected (users, admins, customers).

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

* **Release Manager:** Oversees deployment.
* **DevOps Engineer:** Executes deployment scripts, configures environments.
* **QA Team:** Validates post-deployment.
* **PM:** Communicates to stakeholders.

---

## 4. Deployment Steps

* **Pre-deployment Checklist:**

  * Backup databases.
  * Verify infrastructure readiness.
  * Confirm approvals.

* **Deployment Procedure:**

  * Pull latest code from repo.
  * Build and package application.
  * Deploy backend (e.g., Docker on EC2).
  * Deploy frontend (e.g., S3 + CloudFront).
  * Run migrations (DB changes).
  * Apply configurations (secrets, env vars).

* **Post-deployment Verification:**

  * Smoke tests.
  * Confirm key features (login, API calls, payments).

## 5. Rollback Plan

* **Rollback Triggers:** Deployment fails, major bug, downtime > threshold.
* **Rollback Steps:**

  * Restore DB backup.
  * Revert code to previous stable release.
  * Notify stakeholders.

## 6. Communication Plan

* **Before Deployment:** Notify users of downtime (if any).
* **During Deployment:** Status updates via Slack/Email.
* **After Deployment:** Confirmation of success or issues.

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

* Downtime → Schedule off-peak hours.
* DB migration failure → Run migration dry-runs in staging.
* Performance issues → Use monitoring (CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.).
