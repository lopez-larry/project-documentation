## 2. Overall Description

* **Product Perspective:** Relation to existing systems (standalone, client-server, web app, etc.).
* **Product Functions:** Summary of major capabilities.
* **User Classes & Characteristics:** Who will use it (admin, breeder, customer).
* **Operating Environment:** Platforms, OS, browsers, devices.
* **Design & Implementation Constraints:** Tech stack, frameworks, compliance.
* **Assumptions & Dependencies.**

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

* Broken down by features or use cases.
* Each should include:

  * **ID** (e.g., FR-1)
  * **Description**
  * **Priority** (High/Medium/Low)
  * **Inputs/Outputs**
  * **Pre/Post Conditions**

Example:

* **FR-1:** The system shall allow breeders to upload up to 10 images per dog listing.
* **FR-2:** Customers shall be able to filter dogs by breed, age, and location.
